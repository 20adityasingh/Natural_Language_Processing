NLP Spam Detection


Overview:


This project focuses on detecting spam messages using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. It employs machine learning models to classify messages as either "spam" or "ham" (not spam). The implementation is carried out in a Jupyter Notebook using Python and various NLP libraries.

Features:


        Preprocessing of text data (tokenization, stopword removal, stemming, etc.)

        Vectorization using techniques like TF-IDF

        Training and evaluation of machine learning models

        Performance metrics to assess model accuracy



Technologies Used:


     Python

     Jupyter Notebook

     Pandas & NumPy

     Scikit-learn

     Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)

     Matplotlib & Seaborn (for visualization)




Usage:


Open the Jupyter Notebook:

Navigate to NLP_Spam_Detection.ipynb and run the cells step by step.

The notebook will preprocess the dataset, train a model, and evaluate its performance.



Dataset


The dataset used for spam detection consists of labeled SMS messages. The data undergoes preprocessing before being fed into machine learning models.



Results


The trained model predicts whether a message is spam or ham with a high accuracy.

Various machine learning models can be tested and compared for performance.
